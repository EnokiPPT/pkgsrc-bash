# pkgsrc-bash
Shitty frontend for pkgsrc  
It works, but I doubt it will very well. 

# Usage
in  - Install a package  
rm  - Remove a package  
fd  - Find a package  
up  - Update all packages  
ver - Check pkgsrc-bash version  

Updating does not support individual packages.

If you can run pkgsrc without root, you should be able to run this frontend without root
